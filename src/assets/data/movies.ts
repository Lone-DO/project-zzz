    description: `The sudden visit of beings from off-planet does not bring the conflict that was expected: these alien beings are slow to act and intellectually inferior. Dr. Samier, who is in charge of the investigation, discovers that they have a very special ability — touch. After touching anything, they are able to imitate and change into it. The investigation team led by Dr. Samier begins a new research program to try to transform the aliens into human controllable "tools" and even "resources." What the team doesn't know is that the first target the aliens came into contact with on Earth was Dr. Samier himself.
Although not branded as a suspense film, it has been called a fantasy film that few people can understand in one go. When the identity of the Doctor is revealed, the audience's fear of the extraterrestrials gradually changes to confusion— "There were no humans from the beginning?"`,

A rare film with a Proxy as the main character. The dream scenes deliberately use an old cartoony style, on the one hand, to facilitate the audience to distinguish between dreams and reality, and on the other hand, to also add a distant and unique fantasy atmosphere to the film.`

One of the film's highlights is the minimal use of special effects.
